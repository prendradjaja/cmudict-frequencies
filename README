SUMMARY:
  An estimate of the relative frequencies of English phonemes.
Also, an estimate of the relative frequencies of English phonemes
that follow /w/.


METHODOLOGY:
  Reproducing the work of Doug Blumeyer[1], I correlated the CMU
Pronouncing Dictionary ("CMUdict")[2] and Adam Kilgarriff's
unlemmatized frequency list[3] for the British National Corpus to
find phoneme frequencies generally. I extended this technique to
estimate post-/w/ phoneme frequencies as well.


LIMITATIONS:
  As Blumeyer notes, the source datasets have some limitations.
CMUdict conflates "schwa with the near-open central vowel" and
has "several noticeable errors." Kilgarriff's frequency list has
some formatting issues that make it hard to work with words with
accents and apostrophes, (at this time, I've completely ignored
this issue) including common contractions.

  Blumeyer did manual error checking on several hundred of the
most common words. I have not done this.

  The CMUdict has multiple pronunciations for some words. For
these words, I used only the first pronunciation given. It's not
clear to me if in these cases the multiple pronunciations are
ordered in some way or just ordered arbitrarily.


OTHER NOTES:
  While the Kilgarriff list is for the British National Corpus, a
quick inspection suggests that it uses American pronunciations
over British ones.

To do:
. at or before v1.0.0, include changelog details in tags too
. use more than just first pronunciation in cmudict
. <er> is one phoneme etc
. phone or phoneme?
. rename to phoneme-frequencies? (but really, is it phone or phoneme in this case?)
. manual error checking
. transcribe some of the uncorrelateds
. reread cmloegcmluin
x ARPAbet -> IPA

Changelog:
- v0.3.3: Add correlated_ipa_no_spaces

- v0.3.2: Add correlated_ipa to local_intermediate/

- v0.3.1: Various
  - Move *.py into scripts/
  - Add `make test`

- v0.3.0: Various
  - Add local copies of source data and results
